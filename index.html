							<h2>Sensera Limited Prospectus Download</h2><br>

							<h2>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</h2><br>
							This is important information that should be read in its entirety. If you do not understand it you should consult your professional adviser without delay. The expiry date of the Prospectus is the date that is 13 months from the date of lodgement of the Prospectus. The paper form of the electronic Prospectus (including its attached application form) accessible through this website has been lodged with ASIC.<br><br>
							Applications for securities referred to in the Prospectus must be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Prospectus. Applications for securities must be made on an application form that accompanied a complete hard copy of the Prospectus or the complete unaltered electronic version of the Prospectus.<br><br>
							No applications for securities will be accepted nor will securities be issued on the basis of the Prospectus earlier than seven days after the lodgement of the Prospectus with ASIC or any longer period required under section 727(3) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (“Exposure Period”). No preference will be conferred on applications received during the Exposure Period. The purpose of the Exposure Period is to enable the Prospectus to be examined by market participants and this may result in the identification of deficiencies. In those circumstances, any application received may need to be dealt with in accordance with section 724 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).<br><br>
							The Prospectus does not constitute an offer in any place in which, or to any person to whom, it will not be lawful to make such an offer. No action has been taken to lodge, register or file the Prospectus in any jurisdiction outside Australia. The distribution of this Prospectus outside Australia may be restricted by law and persons who come into possession of this Prospectus outside Australia should seek advice on and observe any such restrictions. The investment described in this Prospectus has not been recommended by any regulatory authority of any jurisdiction including ASIC.<br><br>
